# WILD.AI
Frontend for WILD.AI UNIFI's project. 
The concept of camera trapping as an ecological investigastion system is as follows: every year you have a grid of cameras that take photos automatically using sensors. The collection and identification of these photos allows ecological analysis to biology researchers. More details on:

# Overview
This project aims to design a frontend user interface for the WILD.AI application using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles.
The UI has to collect lots of informations and present them in a way that is appropriate and has a good form for the scenario and the personas.
The UI must be a Web application built through an asynchronous and reactive framework.

Actually, WILD.AI interface is a simply extention of backend that implements the main use cases:
1) create a project
2) add workstations (rooms) to the project and insert a calibration image
3) view rsults of the automatic analysis (box, class name etc)
4) download aggregated data

# Tool & Techniques
The main tools and techniques I will employ are:
- Vue.js
- Material Design guidelines
- Bootstrap
- ARIA guidelines for accessibility

# Expected Outcomes
I expected to obtain, through a process of needfinding, prototyping and usability testing, to 
1) decouple back and front ends using Software Engineering best practices,
2) get the application in the right position of the outer context using Human-Centered principles,
3) and make its use flowent and enjoyable, studying users and their ethics.

The importance of this work lies in creating a dense network of fans of wildlife thanks to which preserving and studying mammals in their own natural environment.
